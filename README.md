# Coding with an AI pair programmer

[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) is your AI pair programmer, built to support you throughout your development experience. As with any new tool, using GitHub Copilot requires learning a few new skills. This project is built to do exactly that, to give you an opportunity to build a project, using the language and tools you typically use, with GitHub Copilot.
