# Create a user experience

With the API created it's time to close everything out by creating a frontend application. While the first two exercises have been relatively prescriptive in the frameworks and style, this exercise offers you the ability to choose the direction you'd like to go for creating a frontend. You can create a website using React or Svelte, a mobile app, a Windows app... Whatever you feel most comfortable with! You can also use this as an opportunity to explore a new framework.

## Defining success

You will have successfully completed the challenge after:

- you have a UI which displays a list of days of the week and airport.
- after the user makes their selection, the API you created is called.
- the result is displayed to the user.

## Tips

As highlighted above, you're free to use the framework you desire and create the type of application you like.

GitHub Copilot does not replace the need for a developer. While it can help guide and generate suggestions, the developer still needs to understand the code being generated. However, it can support a developer as they're exploring a framework for the first time. You can interact with GitHub Copilot through comments, describing what you're looking to accomplish, and seeing the suggested code.

> **NOTE:** If you are using a web frontend framework you may run into CORS issues when calling the API. See if GitHub Copilot can help you out!

## Sparking imagination

Now it's time to put a bow on everything you've been creating up until this point! Call all the APIs you created. Implement client-side caching. Add style and flair!

## Next steps

Congratulations on completing the workshop! Over the course of these challenges you explored how:

- GitHub Copilot can support development.
- to provide context to GitHub Copilot to improve suggestions.
- you need to be flexible when working with AI.
